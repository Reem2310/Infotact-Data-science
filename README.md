Predictive Maintenance Pipeline (CMAPSS Dataset)This repository contains the Week 1: Data Engineering and Baseline Modeling phase of a Predictive Maintenance project. The objective is to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of jet engines and classify potential failures using the NASA CMAPSS dataset.📌 Project OverviewThis script processes raw sensor data from multiple jet engine simulations, performs data cleaning, engineers temporal features, and establishes a baseline classification model to predict engine failure within a 24-hour cycle window.⚙️ Key FeaturesThe pipeline currently performs the following operations:Multi-File Ingestion: Automatically detects and loads multiple CMAPSS training files (train_FD001.txt through train_FD004.txt).Data Cleaning:Removes sensors with zero variance (constant values) to reduce noise.Implements forward-filling strategies to handle missing time-series data.Temporal Feature Engineering:Lag Features: Generates 1-step and 2-step lag features for key sensors (Sensors 2, 3, and 4).Rolling Statistics: Calculates Rolling Mean and Rolling Standard Deviation using a window size of 5.Target Generation:Calculates Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for each engine.Creates a binary target variable failure_24h (1 if RUL $\le$ 24 cycles, 0 otherwise).Exploratory Analysis: Generates and saves a sensor correlation heatmap.Baseline Modeling: Implements a Logistic Regression model with a time-aware train/test split (no shuffling) to respect the temporal nature of the data.📂 Directory StructureTo run the script successfully, ensure your directory looks like this:Plaintext├── CMaps/                     # Create this folder and place input files here

🛠️ Prerequisites & InstallationClone the repositoryInstall Dependencies:The script requires the following Python libraries:pandasnumpymatplotlibseabornscikit-learnYou can install them via pip:Bashpip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Download Data:Download the NASA CMAPSS Jet Engine Data and place the train_FD00x.txt files into a folder named CMaps in the root directory.🚀 UsageRun the Python script to execute the data pipeline:Bashpython "Predictive Maintenance with Explainable AI.py"
OutputsAfter execution, check the output/ directory for:week1_feature_engineered_dataset.csv: The fully processed dataset ready for advanced modeling.correlation_matrix.png: A visualization of sensor correlations.Console Output: The script will print the Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score) for the baseline Logistic Regression model.📊 Baseline ResultsThe script utilizes a Logistic Regression model as a baseline.Split Strategy: Sequential split (Train on past, Test on future) to prevent data leakage.Scaling: Standard Scaler applied to features.Class Weight: Balanced (to handle the rarity of failure events).
